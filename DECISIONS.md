This is the file containing our decision and argumentations on those during our minitwit project

## Week 01

### REWRITING MINITWIT IN GO

The decision to go with Go (pun intended :)) was based on the following reasons:

- minimalistic language with an extensive standard library
- fast, lightweight and scalable
- strongly and statically typed (an advantage over python)
- concurrency is an integral part supported by goroutines and channels
- programs are constructed from packages that offer clear code separation
- google APIs are often written in Go, it would be nice to follow those implementations
- check the hype out???

### Metrics and user statistics

```
Can you figure out the following properties of your _ITU-MiniTwit_ with your group fellows?

    * CPU load during the last hour/the last day.
    * Average response time of your application's front page.
    * Amount of users registered in your system.
    * Average amount of followers a user has.

Keep a log of what you are doing to figure out these values.

For each of the above properties into, categorize them by potentially interested parties in an organization. For example, _business department_ (hypothetical), _operator_, etc.

Which of the above categories do you consider the most important? In which role are you then?
